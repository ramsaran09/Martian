# Martian

This is a simple android application which makes use of **NASA APIs** to display images taken in MARS. We parse JSON data from the API and display the
images and the associated data in a list; user can click on the list item to know more info about the picture. We have also implemented cache to look at previously downloaded data when offline.

# Tech Stack

- This app is developed in **Kotlin**
- I used **MVVM** architecture to develop the app (androidx lifecycle components)
- **Coroutines** for async programming
- **Retrofit** for networking.
- **Koin** for dependency injection
- **Glide** for image loading
- **Lottie** for animation
- I have also utilized Kotlin's extension functions, sealed classes, etc., for efficiency.
